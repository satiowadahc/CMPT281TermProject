Sorry for the late submission, I have an error with my addtocart event listener 
on the buttons and so Im not able to finish the checkout page properly.
This was developed primarily on firefox developers editions with checking for IE9,EDGE 
and one time check on safari. 

Most of the code was unique unless noted other wise in the code.
Notable: 
-Menus were taken from lab 6 solution
-DropDown hamburger menu was adapted from w3 schools
-init() was apadted in an attempt to fix the listeners to no success.

CSS files were all written new for the final submission
about index were taken from old assignments
store was written new from generate feature boxes

Mockbin I used had added modelnum for an identifier that was unique to each product


If I had more time,
-fix eventlisteners
-finish checkout page
(I do have the credit card check working in CC_check folder but I would like to add that after the cart page)
-add response for add to cart
-add drop down menu from cart to see current cart items
